      In this article, the authors speculate on the role that art education
      might play in fostering caring relationships and experiences for
      children.  Inspired by the work of Nel Noddings, the authors offer
      suggestions for developing a caring approach to art education curricula.
      The article introduces strategies that are generally congruent with
      Noddings’ concept of relational ethics and that include the use of (a)
      instructional units based on selected themes of care, (b) cooperative art
      activities, and (c) the willingness of teachers to adopt caring personas
      in their art classrooms.
